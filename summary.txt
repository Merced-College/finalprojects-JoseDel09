My Blackjack game project is a simple Java console application that simulates a basic version of the popular card game Blackjack 21. 
The goal of the game is for the player to draw cards that total as close to 21 as possible without going over, while competing against the dealer. 
So far, I’ve created the basic structure of the game, including a Card class to represent individual cards, a Deck class that builds and shuffles a standard 52 card deck, and a BlackjackGame class that resets the game, deals cards to the player, and prints the player's starting hand. 
Next, I plan to implement player actions like hit or stand, calculate the total value of the player’s hand, and add a dealer that draws cards following Blackjack rules.
